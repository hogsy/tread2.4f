# XTread Level Editor

:construction:

This is a level editor based upon Tread 2.4f, developed by [Joseph Riedel](https://github.com/joeriedel).

Currently, if you hadn't guessed, this is still under heavy development and I would't advise using it at this stage 
(though it will compile and for the most part it works). 
The long-term plan is to rewrite the interface using GTK+ and work towards ensuring the code can compile cross-platform, though
during this process I also aim to introduce new features and usability improvements.

If you want to see the roadmap, you can find it [here](https://trello.com/b/ZFCEYbIh/xtread).

### Why 'XTread'?

I was trying to come up with a cool new name but something that also honored the origins of the project.
Because of the intention to make this cross-platform, XTread seemed appropriate; you can either call it literally 'X Tread'
or '*cross* Tread'.

### Why are you developing an editor?

When working on a game with a group of other really awesome guys a long time ago, we were developing our own fork of the
FitzQuake engine which introduced a huge number of really awesome features.

Unfortunately we had to work around the fact that J.A.C.K. and WorldCraft did not supply functionality 
we needed to easily exploit the new features we added to the engine, so we ended up working around that fact.

Since then I've always wanted to see an open-source level editor that's similar to WorldCraft/Hammer, but
more up-to-date - hence why I'm now undertaking this project.

### Why not contribute to TrenchBroom?

TrenchBroom is a super awesome level editor but the developer has very different priorities to my own.

### When will this be ready?

Literally no clue, this is a huge undertaking and it's literally just a side project to entertain myself.
